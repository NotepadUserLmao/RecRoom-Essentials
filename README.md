RR Essentials

### Overview

 RR Essemtials is a multi-functional utility that provides various enhancements, including custom Discord status updates, an anti-kick feature, and a backpack spawner tool.

### Features

Custom Discord Status: Modify your Discord status dynamically when using the menu.

Anti-Kick Protection: Allows you to not get kicked from a game or PVP using AntiKick.exe.

Backpack Spawner: Enables spawning backpacks using BackPack Spawner.exe. (instructions in discord)

Easy to Use: The script provides a simple way to launch the menu.

### Installation

Download and extract the repository.

Run either the batch version, exe version, or the py version to launch the menu.

### Requirements

Python (if required for status.py)

Windows OS (due to .exe files)

NoteInstaller (free on my github) (because the pips you need are autoinstalled using that, and it's faster to use that)
